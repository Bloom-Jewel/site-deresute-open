# Combo Guard

A basic skill. Allows you to maintain combo when hitting certain judgment under given coverage.

## Standard Stack

Largest CG coverage will take effect.

## Resonance Stack

Each CG coverage added up to stack.

## Negative Stack

Under old CC implementation, CC causes combo break upon failing to hit a PERFECT. Any Combo Guard such as Pure Combo Guard or Overload will offset the effect.
