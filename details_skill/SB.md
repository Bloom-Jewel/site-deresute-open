Icon Notes:
* `x` and `+` sign denotes Skill Boost **multiplies** and **adds** the value respectively.
* `~` means multiplication actually happens but registered as 100% of base value.
* `-` means the skill doesn't have the parameter correlated to it.

Notes:
1. DG skills have extension of HP skill by distinct value.
2. OL skills used to leak out the CG part of boost due to programming error.
