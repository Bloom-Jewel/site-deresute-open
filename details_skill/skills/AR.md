# All Round

A compound skill. This skill is composed of a CU and HP altogether. The skill strength is based on slightly stronger version of their lower rarity counterparts.
However this skill come with uptime tradeoff. As the skill sounds being promising to allow you to put generally permanent compound healer cards in the team, the skill is compensated with rather low activation time in total.
