# Perfect Lock

A basic skill. This skill will convert any given judgment under coverage to PERFECT.

## Standard Stack

Largest PL coverage will take effect.

## Resonance Stack

Each PL coverage added up to stack.

## Negative Stack

Under new CC implementation, CC reduces the timing window of a PERFECT. Any Perfect Lock such as Pure Perfect Lock or Tuning will offset the effect.
