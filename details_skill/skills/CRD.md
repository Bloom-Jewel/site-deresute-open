# Coordinate

A compound skill. This skill is composed of a SU and CU altogether. As players may expect, this skill is composed of very weak SU and standard CU skills.
May sound promising like a FOC skills that doesn't have color limitation, however this more like letting an uptime for a CU more than SU due to the skill property.

## Standard Stack
