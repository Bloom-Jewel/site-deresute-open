A compound skill. This skill is composed of a SU, CU and HP altogether. Despite being slightly weaker percentage of pure skills, this kind of skill allows to maintain high uptime of each respective bonus.
However, there's one catch to use this. **The respective unit must represent a tricolor form**. If it happens to have a guest, the guest color can fill an empty slot of respective attribute, assuming the unit uses 4-1-1 form.
