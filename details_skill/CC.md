# Concentration

## Internal Name: Perfect Ellegant

A compound skill. This skill is composed of a SU and a negative PL which reduces the timing window of your PERFECT hits unless you bring some PL on it. This kind of trade off is rather large when you consider a MARVELOUS SU (100%x122%) vs GREAT (70%x117%?) comparison in terms of both CC and GREAT SU activates together.

During early implementation of this, this skill is composed of SU and a negative GREAT CG. Which pulls the combo break border even more prone than usual. Most of the players are avoiding to use this due to unfavorable tradeoff when compared to Overload skill.
