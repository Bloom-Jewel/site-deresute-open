# Overload

## Internal Name: Sacrifice

A compound skill. This skill is composed of a SU and CG altogether. There are no natural BAD CG so far, so this skill also considered as exclusive triggering effects. Either you manage to trigger the SU, or the CG, but not both. This skill requires certain amount of HP before triggering, and will not trigger if your HP is exactly same or less than specified amount.

## Trivia

- During the initial release of Skill Boost, CG-side of this skill is not "Fixed" and managed to tank a BAD into MISS due to programming error. The supposed `-2` of CG side managed to leak out into `-1202` due to how CG and SB reacts.
- With scarcity of proper HP cards on early time, this skill regarded as Soft Sudden Death among the players. Which makes a play must be done great or bust.
